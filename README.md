## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the Multi-School Management System on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following software installed on your system:

- [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) or [WAMP](http://www.wampserver.com/en/) (for Apache and MySQL)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
   
   Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/codewithvishaldk/sms-php
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**
   
   Change to the project directory using the following command:
   ```sh
   cd multi-school-management-system
   ```

3. **Set up the database**
   
   - Open your MySQL database management tool (e.g., phpMyAdmin).
   - Create a new database, for example: `school_management`.
   - Import the provided SQL script to set up the necessary tables and data:
     ```sh
     mysql -u your-username -p school_management < database.sql
     ```
     Or use phpMyAdmin to import the `database.sql` file.

4. **Configure the application**
   
   Open the `config.php` file in a text editor and update the database configuration with your credentials:
   ```php
   define('DB_SERVER', 'localhost');
   define('DB_USERNAME', 'root');
   define('DB_PASSWORD', '');
   define('DB_DATABASE', 'school_management');
   ```

5. **Run the application**
   
   - Start your local server (e.g., using XAMPP or WAMP).
   - Open your web browser and navigate to the application URL, typically `http://localhost/sms-php`.

### Troubleshooting

- Ensure your Apache and MySQL services are running.
- Double-check your database credentials in the `config.php` file.
- Verify that the `database.sql` script has been successfully imported into your MySQL database.

### Optional: Setting Up Virtual Host (for easier access)

1. **Edit your hosts file**

   Add the following line to your `hosts` file:
   ```sh
   127.0.0.1   school-management.local
   ```

2. **Configure Apache**

   Add the following block to your Apache `httpd-vhosts.conf` file:
   ```apache
   <VirtualHost *:80>
       ServerAdmin webmaster@school-management.local
       DocumentRoot "path-to-your-project-directory/multi-school-management-system"
       ServerName school-management.local
       ErrorLog "logs/school-management.local-error.log"
       CustomLog "logs/school-management.local-access.log" common
   </VirtualHost>
   ```

3. **Restart Apache**

   Restart your Apache server for the changes to take effect. Now, you can access the application by navigating to
   `http://school-management.local`.
